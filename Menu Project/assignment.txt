Write a Menu-Driven Program in python. Build and submit the program in zyBooks. Note that the program will not be auto-graded. See the rubric below.

Assignment Requirements:

The program must use a while loop to repeat the program until the user quits.
The program must use if statements to execute blocks of code based on the user's selection.
